            The purpose of the CandyShop website is to sell candy to both customers and other small businesses around
            the area. Customers will be able to log in to the website and search for their favorite candy to purchase
            before placing an order. All local customers will have the courtesy to have their orders delivered to their

            Service
        </h3>
        <p class="shade">
            The service that will be provided by the CandyShop website will sell strictly all kinds of well-known
            candies such as Reese's peanut butter cups, Twix, Snickers, M&M's, Gummi bears, Kit Kat, and many other new
            candies on the market will also be served at the CandyShop. The website will also be collecting data on the
            candy that is mostly purchased by customers. This will help in knowing which type of candy the shop should
            invest in more.
