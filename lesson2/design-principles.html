                This website is basically about helping people find jobs in my country. Anyone can use it so long as you
                are old enough to get employed by any company of your choosing.<br><br> The reason I selected this
                website is
                that it clearly demonstrates a good principle of visual hierarchy from the moment you enter the
                website.<br><br>
                The most important information is found at the top, like keywords, location, and category, so that you
                are able to search for a job without having to go to and look at the jobs available on the list.

            <p>
                This website is the Royal Science & Technology Park official website, looking good and clean. I chose
                this website because it's quite interesting how well the design principle of proximity was used.<br><br>
                As you
                can see from the image above, the group of related items is grouped together and they are close to each
                other, making them easily identified as related rather than unrelated.<br><br> Having the logo well
                placed at
                the top, the name of the company is nicely placed as well. The words can be clearly seen with good color
                choice. I just think the disnger there did an amazing job when putting this together.

            <h1>Design Principle: Contrast</h1>
            <h2>Adidas</h2>
            <p>To access the company website directly click the link: <a href="https://www.adidas.com/us/" target="_blank">Adidas.com/us</a></p>
            <img class="adidas-img" src="images/adidas.PNG" alt="inc-image">
            <p>
                The image above shows the official website of the well-known clothing label Adidas. On this website,
                this is where the company advertise and sell all their products to their customers world wide.<br><br>
                The
                reason I chose this website is the fact that the designer used very good color contrast. The images were
                well combined, maintaining good contrast. It is clear and does not disturb where the user needs to go
                when they need to find it.<br><br> Using the black and white colors for the contrast made the overall
                design of
                the website look very nice and also matched well with the rest of the other colors and the Adidas
                company logo.
